DEADLINE `2013-11-11` ESTIMATEDHOURS `0`  

[*speccer*](https://github.com/metakeule/speccer) is a CLI tool for dealing with specs.

It is a frontend to the [speclib](https://github.com/metakeule/speclib).




## SCENARIO 1 Create Specification

******


## SCENARIO 5 Import and export

from different places.


******


## SCENARIO 6 View as HTML and markdown

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Sue wants to read the specifications in HTML and 
be able to mail them as markdown.


******


## SCENARIO 7 Filter for documentation

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Peter wants to create a documentation from the spec and
wants the unneccessary informations to be filtered.

******


## SCENARIO 8 Filter for implementation

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Anne wants to implement parts of the specification.
She just wants to read the parts that are ready
to be implemented.

## NONGOAL 1 No GUI

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

To have a GUI would be a project on its own.
However such a project could also be external and be built upon speccer.

******


## NONGOAL 2 No Database

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

`speccer` will operate on plain text json files only.
There will be no way to have a database and search.
A database could however exchange data with `speccer`
via json files.

******


## NONGOAL 3 No versioning

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

`speccer` will not do any backups or have versions.
You are advised to use a version control system to save your
specs or make backups by a backup tool.

******


## NONGOAL 4 No editing

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

`speccer` will have any functionality of an editor.
You may however replace parts of the spec by exporting them
to your favourite editor and reimport them when you are finished.

******


## NONGOAL 5 No merging of specs

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

`speccer` won't provide any mechanism to merge specs.
Since you can export and import parts of the specs in
plain text or markdown, it is not hard to merge by hand.

******


## NONGOAL 6 No copying of specs

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

`speccer` won't help you copying specs, since you can simply
copy the json files yourself and then edit the copy.

******


## NONGOAL 7 No rights management

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

`speccer` won't have any rights management baked in. 
You could manage the viewing and changing rights for
a single spec by the filesystem.

If you need finer control, you need to write a wrapper
around `speccer` or the `speclib`.

******


## NONGOAL 8 No multiple comments per author and paragraph

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

With `speclib` (and therefor `speccer` too),
a single author can only have one comment per paragraph.

We consider this a good thing, since it forces the spec
to be split up in several paragraphs if they get too many
comments. The spec will benefit from it.

Also it is possible to have comments of arbitrary length.


******


## NONGOAL 9 No 'threads'

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Again this is a decision by `speclib` and considered a good 
thing. There should not be comments on comments and endless
discussions. Instead the comments should be directed to a 
paragraph and decision should be made soon.

Then the different topics should seperate into the different
sections like 'UNDECIDED', 'CONTRADICTIONS', 'DEFINITIONS',
'FEATURES' etc. and there should be multiple paragraphs 
which may each have their own state of consense and comments.


******


## NONGOAL 10 No order of comments

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Again this is a decision by `speclib`.
Since each author may just have one comment per paragraph, 
there is no point in have an order for comments.

However their is an order of paragraphs and that could 
be changed.


******


## NONGOAL 11 No text generation

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Since the specs format is based on json, it is very easy 
and flexible to have own templates and copy them.

******


## NONGOAL 12 No PDF export

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

There are great tools to convert from HTML to PDF, like `wkhtmltopdf` and
also markdown to pdf converter like `pandoc`. Since `speccer` exports 
to HTML and markdown you should be able to use these tools to generate
PDFs.

******


## NONGOAL 13 No Translations for SPECS

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

There is rudimentary support for translations of key words that
are automatically inserted via `speclib`.

If your language is not supported, it is very easy to translate 
on your own. A simple bash-script will do. You only have to
replace the keys as they are in the translations folders.

You might also contribute your translations to the project.

However for the main text of the specs they should be translated
by creating a new spec of each language and telling the other
specs of the translation in the TRANSLATIONS section of the specs.

******


## NONGOAL 14 No time tracking

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Each paragraph has a field ESTIMATEDHOURS that could be used to
do basic scheduling.

An external tool could then collect the estimated hours and compare
them to the real time to drive conclusions about the schedule.

More time tracking functionality is not part of this project.


******


## NONGOAL 15 No shortcuts for commands or presets

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Some commands and options are hard to remember.
But instead of bake new options into `speccer` we
deliver an alias file you could use in your bash or zsh shell.

Have a look at it to see how easy you could do one on your own.
In the alias you could also set defaults for responsibles etc.


******


## NONGOAL 16 No translation of options

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `APPROVED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-12` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

In order to be able to associate the wordings of the options
to the corresponding keys in the json file and the untranslated
specs the options will not be translated.

## CONTRADICTION 1 Rights Management vs responsible

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `OBSOLET` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-11` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

Rights Management is a Non Goal but on the other hand we have
persons responsible for paragraphs. 

If anyone may edit any paragraph, then the responsibility
must constantly change (and is worthless) or it is false.


> `mra`  
>   
> Yes the responsability should change often in order to request feedback.  
> If multiple persons work on a spec, the spec is considered teamwork  
> and the people should work together.  
>   
> Only one person is responsible for each paragraph at a single point in  
> time. This could be enforced by external tools as well as rights management  
> if necessary. Although with version control it should not be necessary.


## UNDECIDED 1 It is not really clear how the linefeed is

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `OBSOLET` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-12`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-11` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  

exported in markdown and json.
See the linefeed paragraph

> `mra`  
>   
> No longer an issue. Every import and export replaces  
> to `\n` only. Editors should be able to handle it,   
> otherwise other tools would be needed to convert  
> before editing.


## DEFINITION 1 All definitions of the `speclib` apply

## DEFINITION 4 Current Spec

RESPONSIBLE `mra`  
STATE `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` LASTUPDATE `2013-11-13`  
DEADLINE `2013-11-13` ESTIMATEDHOURS `1`  


The current spec is the spec that is loaded from a special file
in the current directory (`pwd`).

If the `-language` option is set, the spec is loaded from the file
`spec_[language].json`, e.g.

    spec_en_US.json

Otherwise it is looking for any files matching the regular expression

    spec*.json

If there is just one file matching, the spec is loaded from this file.
Otherwise an error is thrown mentioning that the language option should
probably be set.

## FEATURE 1 create a new spec

RESPONSIBLE `mra`

Go into a folder that should contain your spec and run

    speccer -cmd create

Creates a file `spec.json` in the current folder and exports it
as `spec.md` (Markdown) and `spec.html` (HTML).

If the `-language` parameter is set (to e.g. `en_US`) it creates
the following files instead:

- `spec_en_US.json`
- `spec_en_US.md`
- `spec_en_US.html`

Be aware that the new spec is not valid since there are missing
properties. You can validate a spec to see them:

    speccer -cmd validate
